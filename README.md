# Dissertation_Image-Segmentation

This contains Matlab code to segment fluorescent photographs that I have written for my dissertation project. The routine provides a way to analyze the flow behavior of liquid resin during the production of fiber-reinforced plastics parts. The method is described in detail in the thesis which is also attached. The pdf is also retreivable from https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1335378.

The folder img_process contains four reference fotographs that can be processed by the algorithms. 
The folder fluorescent_microscopy contains a similar routine for processing of images from a fluorescent microscope.
